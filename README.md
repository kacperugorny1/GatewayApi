# GatewayApi

It's part of the Weather station project.<br>
I'm hosting this API as a http only on the VPS. I needed to make this because my sim800l has outdated and can't be used with azure api. This app will be a gateway to the api hosted on the azure - methods called will external api that has all the logic.<br><br>
For now this api saves data in the file, because person responsible for the api didn't make much progress yet.
